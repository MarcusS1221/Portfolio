                      I made Pongify when I just got into game development. 
                      It was the first project iI ever coded apart from some 
                      small projects that I learned in school. When I first started  
                      coding, my main goal was to take old classic games and turn it 
                      into new ones with a better style and feel to it.

                      Snek was the second game I ever released, it took me around 
                      a year to develop as I wanted to put a lot more focus on it and 
                      make a big improvement from my previous project. When creating 
                      this game I still followed the same motivation to take an old classic
                      game and make it better or more modernized.

                        I created Flappy Socks purely just for the fun of it. 
                        I was in the mood to create a sillier game that doesnâ€™t focus on having 
                        a main goal but rather just entertain you. I have always wanted to add my cat 
                        into my games and projects in some way and I guess this was the perfect opportunity.
